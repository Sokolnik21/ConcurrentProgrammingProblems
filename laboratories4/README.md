- Stream processing with buffer
  - One buffer (size doesn't matter) with cells, one consumer (possible variant: multiple consumers), multiple producers
  - Each cell starts with base state
    - To simplify:
      - base cell value: -1
  - Each producer can change the value of a cell only if current state of the cell matches the requirements of the producer
    - To simplify:
      - Cell's values: [-1..(N - 1)] where N = number of producers
      - Each producer is unique and has id in [0..(N - 1)]
      - Each producer changes value from (x - 1) to x where x equals id
  - Consumer is an another "producer"
    - To simplify:
      - Consumer changes value from (N - 1) (N = the number of producers) to base cell's state (in this example: -1)
- Producers and consumers with random quantity of cells that will modify
  - One buffer (with 2M size) with cells, multiple consumers, multiple producers
  - Each cell starts with base state
  - Each producer changes (at once!) random quantity of cells from [base state] to [modified state]
  - Each producer changes (also at once) random quantity of cells from [modified state] to [base state]
